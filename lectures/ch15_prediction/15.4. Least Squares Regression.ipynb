    "We saw this in the example about Little Women, but let’s confirm it in an example where the scatter plot clearly isn’t football shaped. For the data, we are once again indebted to the rich data archive of Prof. Larry Winner of the University of Florida. A 2013 study in the International Journal of Exercise Science studied collegiate shot put athletes and examined the relation between strength and shot put distance. The population consists of 28 female collegiate athletes. Strength was measured by the the biggest amount (in kilograms) that the athlete lifted in the “1RM power clean” in the pre-season. The distance (in meters) was the athlete’s personal best."
