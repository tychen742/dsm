    "# Sample Mean Variability\n",
    "\n",
    "- By the Central Limit Theorem, the **probability distribution of the mean of a large random sample is roughly normal**. The **bell curve is centered at the population mean**. Some of the sample means are higher, and some lower, but the **deviations from the population mean are roughly symmetric** on either side, as we have seen repeatedly. **Formally, probability theory shows that the sample mean is an unbiased estimate of the population mean**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our simulations, we also noticed that the **means of larger samples tend to be more tightly clustered around the population mean than means of smaller samples**. In this section, we will quantify the variability of the sample mean and develop a relation between the variability and the sample size.\n",
