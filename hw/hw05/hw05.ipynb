    "1. The noteook:\n",
    "    1. Use **Jupyter Notebook** as instructed. We do not have the resources to support <font color=\"darkred\">**Anaconda** or **VS Code**</font>. \n",
    "    2. Provide your answers in the designated spaces.\n",
    "    3. Do not reassign variables in the notebooks! For example, if you use `max_temperature` in your answer to one question, do not reassign it later on (e.g., as an intermediate variable). Otherwise, you will fail the tests that you thought you were passing previously!\n",
    "2. Grading:\n",
    "    1. Points will be scaled in Canvas.\n",
    "    2. Most \"tests\" in this assignment test the **format and data types** of your answers, not their **correctness**. Passing **100%** of the **tests** does not mean your **grade** will be 100%.\n",

    "    2. <font color='darkred'>**Use AI to LEARN, not to cheat**. **DO NOT copy-n-paste**</font>: You will be competing with people who are as good as you in AI, and you will have the competitive edge when you are one of the few who know how to do things without AI. \n",
    "    3. Collaboration and using resources are encouraged, but DO NOT directly share answers. Upon typing up answers, do it yourself. \n",
    "4. Getting help:\n",
    "    1. Come to the TA's help sessions and the instructor's office hours for help and clarification.\n",
    "    2. Text a screenshot of your technical issue to the instructor.\n",
    "    3. Emailing the instructor and the TA. (Emailing is too slow for technical problem-solving, so do not expect quick responses.)\n",
