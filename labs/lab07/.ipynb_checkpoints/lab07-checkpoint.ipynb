    "**Attention:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Using the Notebook**\n",
    "    - Use Jupyter Notebook as instructed. We do **not** have the resources to support Anaconda or VS Code. \n",
    "    - Provide your answers in the designated spaces.\n",
    "    - Do not reassign variables! For example, if you use `max_temperature` for one question, do not reassign it later on (e.g., as an intermediate variable). Doing so may cauae you to fail tests you passed previously!\n",
    "2. **Grading**:\n",
    "    - Points may be scaled in Canvas.\n",
    "    - Most tests check the format and data types of your answers, not their correctness. Passing the tests does not guarantee the grade will be 100%.\n",
    "3. Academic honor:\n",
    "    - **DO NOT CHEAT!** Academic honor matters.  \n",
    "    - <font color='darkred'>**Use AI to LEARN, not to cheat**. **DO NOT copy-and-paste**</font>. Your advantage comes from your knowledge and skills on the subject. Do not rely on AI. \n",
    "    - Collaboration and using resources are encouraged, but **DO NOT directly share answers**. Always answer the questions and solve the problems by yourself. \n",
    "4. Getting help:\n",
    "    - Attend the TA's help sessions and the instructor's office hours.\n",
    "5. <font color=\"darkred\">**Time management**</font>: Start early in the assignment cycle and allocate enough time to complete the assignment properly."
