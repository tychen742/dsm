    "    2. Provide your answers in the designated spaces.\n",
    "    3. Do not reassign variables in the notebooks! For example, if you use `max_temperature` in your answer to one question, do not reassign it later on (e.g., as an intermediate variable). Otherwise, you will fail the tests that you thought you were passing previously!\n",
    "2. Grading:\n",
    "    1. Points will be scaled in Canvas.\n",
    "    2. Most \"tests\" in this assignment test the **format and data types** of your answers, not their **correctness**. Passing **100%** of the **tests** does not mean your **grade** will be 100%.\n",

    "    2. Text a screenshot of your technical issue to the instructor.\n",

Emily would be on the other side and would flip a fair coin. Depending on how the coin landed, she would put out either her left hand or her right hand. The TT practitioner would then have to answer which hand Emily put out. If a pracitioner could truly interact with a person's HEF, it would be expected that they answered correctly.\n",

Conceptually, you may think of this as the case where less than 5% of simulated values are as far or farther away from what we had expected.
