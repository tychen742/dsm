    "    2. Provide your answers in the designated spaces.\n",
    "    3. Do not reassign variables in the notebooks! For example, if you use `max_temperature` in your answer to one question, do not reassign it later on (e.g., as an intermediate variable). Otherwise, you will fail the tests that you thought you were passing previously!\n",
    "2. Grading:\n",
    "    1. Points will be scaled in Canvas.\n",
    "    2. Most \"tests\" in this assignment test the **format and data types** of your answers, not their **correctness**. Passing **100%** of the **tests** does not mean your **grade** will be 100%.\n",

    "    2. Text a screenshot of your technical issue to the instructor.\n",

For CEOs with no previous year on record, it instead says \"(No previous year)\".  The values in this column are *strings*, not numbers, so like the `Total Pay` column, it's not usable without a bit of extra work.\n",

For example, if your pay is $\\$120$ this year, and that's an increase of 50% from the previous year, then your previous year's pay was $\\frac{\\$120}{1 + \\frac{50}{100}}$, or \\$80.\n",
