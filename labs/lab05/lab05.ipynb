    "    3. Do not reassign variables in the notebooks! For example, if you use `max_temperature` in your answer to one question, do not reassign it later on (e.g., as an intermediate variable). Otherwise, you will fail the tests that you thought you were passing previously!\n",
    "2. Grading:\n",
    "    1. Points will be scaled in Canvas.\n",
    "    2. Most \"tests\" in this assignment test the **format and data types** of your answers, not their **correctness**. Passing **100%** of the **tests** does not mean your **grade** will be 100%.\n",
