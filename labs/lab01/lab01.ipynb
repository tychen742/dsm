    "Collaborating on labs is more than okay -- it's encouraged! You should rarely remain stuck for more than a few minutes on questions in labs, so ask a classmate, the TA, or the instructor for help. (Explaining things is beneficial, too -- the best way to solidify your knowledge of a subject is to explain it.) **Please don't just share answers**, though.\n",

    "   2. For Windows, Enter \"./.venv/Scripts/activate\" \n",

    "   1. type **```%pip install datascience```** and hit Enter key (this will take a while, like minutes)\n",
    "   2. type **```%pip install otter-grader```** and Enter key. \n",
